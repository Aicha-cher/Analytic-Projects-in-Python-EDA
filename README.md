# Analytic-Projects-in-Python
Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Analysis projects Python 


## What is this repository about?

When I do some works, I would love to share with people and exchange the knowledges, in this case, we can learn from each other
and help each other to improve the coding skills. I put some analytic projects that I have done by using Python in this file, I will love
to see how people put their opinion on it and also you can feel free to take some of my codes as the reference in your works.

## What projects are in this repository?
- AB Test 

**E-commerce website A/B testing**

>This project is aim at understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website, and help the company understand if 
they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decisionby.
To complete this project, I need to have some basic understanding of `hypothese H0`, `hypothese H1`and `probability`.

- Data Wrangling 

**WeRateDog tweets analysis**

>I used 3 datasets from Twitter related to the account `Weratedog` to complete this project. The main goal for this project is to
practice how to wrangle the massive complex dataset by **Gathering data**, **Accessing data**, **Cleaning data**, **Analyzing data**, **Visualizing data**. Also you can see some very interesting findings in the end of my analysis.

- Deep Learning 

**Flower Image Classifier**

>As the name of this project, I am using the deep learning knowledge to create a APP to be able to classify the different image. The dataset I used is the famous `iris`flowers dataset which contains 102 flower categories. I needed to train the data, create a model to be able to predict what flower is it when the a random flower image shows up.

- Movie Data Analysis

**IMDB movie review score**

>This project is very close to our real life, I used the dataset from `IMDB movie`, try to see the historical data. Bring in these questions in my analsysis: Which genres are most popular from year to year? What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues? Does higher budget films receive higher revenue? Or does the higher voted score films have the higher revenue?


## What you can do with my projects?

You can feel free to comment on my projects, find the bugs or tell me what your thoughts about my coding, analysis and insight. You can contact with me through my email: saizhang123@gmail.com. I will love to hear your ideas.
You can also take some codes away if you think some of them can be useful for your projects.
