# Analytic-Projects-in-Python
Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Analysis projects Python 


## What is this repository about?

When I do some works, I would love to share with people and exchange the knowledges, in this case, we can learn from each other
and help each other to improve the coding skills. I put some analytic projects that I have done by using Python in this file, I will love
to see how people put their opinion on it and also you can feel free to take some of my codes as the reference in your works.

## What projects are in this repository?
- ###AB Test


>This project is aim at understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website, and help the company understand if 
they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decisionby.
To complete this project, I need to have some basic understanding of `hypothese H0`, `hypothese H1`and `probability`.
